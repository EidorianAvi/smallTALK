## General Info
smallTalk is a social app that encourages one on one conversation and connection driven by hobby and interest based topics. A user can initiate or take up a topic they find interesting, converse with other users, and make and save connections for further discussion.

## Inspiration 
The inspiration behind smallTalk was due to the desire to always have someone to chat with a topic no matter how niche. There are plenty of forums out there but it's easy for your voice to be heard and it's easy to get lost in all the noise. Now there's a way to make that one on one conversation happen with someone with the same interests.
